## About the app:

Metatone Lonsdale is a collaborative musical instrument created for a performance at Everything Nothing Projects at Lonsdale St Traders in Canberra, Australia. Tapping and swiping the screen controls sounds sampled from the venue as well as an array of percussive sounds. Switches control a "looping" function and an autoplay feature that triggers clusters of quiet sounds. The sounds and tonality of the instrument can be shuffled by pressing the "sounds" button 

When multiple devices running Metatone Lonsdale are on the same wifi network, the apps find each other automatically and control each others' tonality, looping and autoplay switches.

_MetaLonsdale_ performed by _Ensemble Metatone_ at the ANU School of Music, Canberra in August 2014. This recording was later released as the group's [self-titled debut album on Bandcamp](http://charlesmartin.bandcamp.com/album/ensemble-metatone). The track notes read: 

> First created for a gallery opening in Canberra's "Lonsdale St Traders", the app-instrument for MetaLonsdale blends field recordings from the area's caf√©s and shops with the textures of tuned percussion. While the four players improvise their parts, network connections between the iPads challenge their instincts by changing the sounds and effects under their fingers while matching their harmonic structure.
